# HitlerHax Leak ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Yaimsputnik5/HitlerHax-Leak) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Yaimsputnik5/HitlerHax-Leak)](https://github.com/Yaimsputnik5/HitlerHax-Leak/releases/latest) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Yaimsputnik5/HitlerHax-Leak/total)

## Context: HitlerHax was/is a client which was started by the Imps, named ImpHack, then renamed by MaxRockatasky to Anti-ImpHack, and then eventually to HitlerHax. He had asked me to help him with the client, and had invited me to the repository. The first thing I had done was re-wrote the ENTIRE README.md. Shortly after I began working with Max, I had noticed the skid, and ego in him come out, and promptly took it up with him directly. To which he promptly kicked me from the repo, like a child. So... without further ado, I give you the official HitlerHax leak. P.S. I will leave the original .git history and the old README, just so you see how skiddy Max is.
